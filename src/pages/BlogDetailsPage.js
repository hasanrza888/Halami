      Travel is an incredible way to explore the world, but it comes with its challenges. Sustainable travel is about reducing your environmental footprint while ensuring positive impacts on local communities.
      
      One way to achieve this is by choosing eco-friendly accommodations, such as hotels that utilize renewable energy or prioritize waste reduction. Supporting local businesses, like family-owned restaurants and craft shops, also plays a vital role.
